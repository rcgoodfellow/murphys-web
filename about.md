My name is Ryan Goodfellow. I am a computer scientist at [ISI](http://www.isi.edu). My focus is on the modeling and virtual materialization of cyber-physical systems (CPS). I work on the [Deter](https://www.deter-project.org) project that focuses on modeling and emulating cyber networked systems, and I started a project called [dypy](http://dypy.org) that focuses on the modeling and simulation of physical systems.
